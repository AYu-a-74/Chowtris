Important message!

This is an 'original' Tetris game
!
There are 9 levels in the game, Level 0 to Level 8!
You complete a level either by clearing enough lines, or surviving through the time given!
The block's falling speed will increase each level! Level 4 and Level 8 are the quickest!
 Failing those levels makes you lose the game! But Failing Level 4 does not!
Each time you pass a level, you will go to a shop with a zombie NPC inside!
The zombie NPC will sell you powerful items to help you succeed in the game!
You will receive Chowins once you complete a level! Quadruple Chowins for completing Level 4!
You use Chowins to buy items in the shop!
Bomb costs 5 Chowins! Clear Boost causes 4 Chowins! Chow God's Bless costs 50 Chowins!
Be aware! You Chowins will be cleared to 0 once you leave the shop! So buy items as much as you can!
You enter the next level once you exits the shop! and you can use your newly bought items!

Keys for the game:
'A' for moving the block left!
'D' for moving the block right!
'S' for moving the block down faster!
'E' for rotating the block!
'1' for using the bomb item!
'2' for using the clear boost item!

Keys for the shop:
'T' for talking with the NPC zombie!
'Q' for exiting the shop!
'Left_arrow' for purchasing the bomb item!
'Right_arrow' for purchasing the clear boost item!
'Up_arrow' for purchasing the Chow God's Bless item!

Item information:
'Bomb': When activated, your next line clear can destroy 2 rows above the actual line clear you made!
'Chow God's Bless': When you have this item and loses a level, this item will 'Chow God's Bless': When you have this item and loses a level, this item will save you from losing the game,
making you complete that level instantly, and send you to the shop!
 You can only buy this item once from the shop!

After you pass level 8, you win!
If your blocks are stuck to the top, you lose!
 You will not lose the game if you fail Level 4,
or if you fail a level with Chow God's Bless in hand!

Good Luck from saving you from FORCES!
